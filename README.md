## 🔍 Core Features

| Feature | Description |
|------|------|
| 🧠 AST Deep Analysis | Parses the syntax tree through LibCST to accurately detect issues such as unused variables, hardcoded passwords, and SQL injection vulnerabilities |
| 🛠️ Automatic Repair Suggestions | Integrates GitHub Copilot-style code repair recommendations for one-click code optimization |
| 📐 Multi-dimensional Rules | Built-in security/performance/convention rule templates with YAML support for custom extensions |
| 🔄 Git Pre-commit Interception | Pre-commit Hook integration for automatic quality inspection before commits |
| 📊 Visualized Reports | Generates HTML/JSON format detection results for CI/CD integration |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
pip install codepolice
```

### Usage Examples
```bash
# Scan code in the current directory
codepolice check .

# Automatically fix correctable issues
codepolice fix .

# Initialize Git Hook
codepolice hook install
```

### Output Example
```bash
🔍 2 issues detected:
File: app.py:15
⚠️  [security] Hardcoded password - password = '123456'
   💡 Suggestion: Use environment variables → os.getenv("DB_PASSWORD")

File: utils.py:8
⛔ [convention] Function name does not follow snake_case convention (MyFunction)
   💡 Repair suggestion: Rename to my_function
```

## ⚙️ Configure Rules

Create `codepolice.yaml` in the project root directory:
```yaml
rules:
  hardcoded_secret:
    level: error
    message: "Hardcoded sensitive information detected"
  
  max_line_length:
    level: warning
    options:
      length: 100
```
