> Revolutionize your code quality control with Code Police! Say goodbye to traditional regex-based code analysis and embrace the power of AST analysis. Integrated with AI repair suggestions, Code Police is your frontline defender for high - quality code.

## 🌟 Why Choose Code Police?
### 1. 🧠 Deep AST Analysis
Code Police leverages the power of LibCST to parse the syntax tree of your Python code. This enables it to precisely detect a wide range of issues, from unused variables and hardcoded passwords to SQL injection vulnerabilities. Unlike traditional regex - based tools, AST analysis provides a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of your code.

### 2. 🛠️ AI - Powered Automatic Repair Suggestions
Inspired by GitHub Copilot, Code Police offers intelligent code repair recommendations. With just one click, you can optimize your code and fix common issues, saving you time and effort.

### 3. 📐 Multi - Dimensional Rule System
Our built - in rule templates cover security, performance, and coding conventions. And the best part? You can easily extend these rules using YAML, tailoring the code analysis to your specific project needs.

### 4. 🔄 Git Pre - commit Interception
Integrate Code Police with Git Pre - commit Hook to automatically perform quality inspections before every commit. This ensures that only high - quality code makes it into your repository.

### 5. 📊 Visualized Reports
Generate reports in HTML or JSON format, making it easy to integrate with your CI/CD pipeline. Get a clear overview of your code quality at a glance.

## 🚀 Quick Start
### Installation
```bash
pip install codepolice
```

### Usage Examples
```bash
# Scan code in the current directory
codepolice check .

# Automatically fix correctable issues
codepolice fix .

# Initialize Git Hook
codepolice hook install
```

### Output Example
```bash
🔍 2 issues detected:
File: app.py:15
⚠️  [security] Hardcoded password - password = '123456'
   💡 Suggestion: Use environment variables → os.getenv("DB_PASSWORD")

File: utils.py:8
⛔ [convention] Function name does not follow snake_case convention (MyFunction)
   💡 Repair suggestion: Rename to my_function
```

## ⚙️ Configure Rules
Create `codepolice.yaml` in the project root directory to customize your rules:
```yaml
rules:
  hardcoded_secret:
    level: error
    message: "Hardcoded sensitive information detected"
  
  max_line_length:
    level: warning
    options:
      length: 100
```

## 🧪 Supported Rule Types
| Category | Example Rules |
|------|----------|
| Security | Hardcoded passwords, insecure eval usage, XSS vulnerabilities |
| Performance | Unnecessary loop nesting, inefficient list comprehensions |
| Convention | PEP8 naming checks, redundant imports, overly long functions |
| Maintainability | Cyclomatic complexity detection, duplicate code identification |
